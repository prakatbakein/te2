# Testing Protocol

## Overview

This document outlines the testing protocol for our Job Board Platform. It defines how the main agent and testing sub-agents should coordinate to ensure comprehensive testing coverage.

## Testing Sub-Agents

### 1. deep_testing_backend_v2

- **Purpose**: Backend API testing using curl and comprehensive endpoint validation
- **Scope**: Authentication, job endpoints, data validation, error handling
- **When to use**: After any backend code changes, before frontend testing

### 2. auto_frontend_testing_agent

- **Purpose**: Frontend UI testing using Playwright browser automation
- **Scope**: User interactions, form submissions, navigation, visual validation
- **When to use**: After frontend changes, requires explicit user permission

## Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Backend Testing (Mandatory)

1. **Always test backend first** using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
2. **Required before any frontend testing**
3. **Update test_result.md** with backend test results
4. **Fix any backend issues** before proceeding

### Phase 2: Frontend Testing (User Permission Required)

1. **STOP and ask user** whether to test frontend using `ask_human` tool
2. **Only proceed if user explicitly agrees** to frontend testing
3. **Use auto_frontend_testing_agent** if permission granted
4. **Update test_result.md** with frontend test results

## Communication Protocol

### With Testing Sub-Agents

1. **Provide clear context** about what to test
2. **Specify the scope** (authentication, specific endpoints, user flows)
3. **Include relevant details** about recent changes
4. **Request specific feedback** on critical functionalities

### With User

1. **Always ask permission** before frontend testing
2. **Provide clear explanation** of what will be tested
3. **Respect user preferences** if they want to test manually
4. **Update them** on testing progress and results

## Test Result Management

### Updating test_result.md

1. **Read current state** before testing
2. **Update with new results** after each test phase
3. **Maintain test history** for debugging purposes
4. **Track stuck tasks** and retry counts

### Test Categories

- **Authentication**: Login, signup, token validation
- **Job Management**: CRUD operations, permissions
- **Integration**: End-to-end user workflows
- **Performance**: Response times, error handling

## Incorporate User Feedback

### User Testing Feedback Integration

When users report issues or provide feedback on application functionality:

1. **Document user feedback** in agent_communication section
2. **Prioritize user-reported issues** as "high" priority tasks
3. **Test user-specific scenarios** that led to the reported issues
4. **Validate fixes** with the exact user workflow that failed
5. **Update test cases** to prevent regression of user-reported issues

### User Preference Handling

- **Respect testing preferences**: If user prefers manual testing, don't insist on automated testing
- **Collaborative approach**: Work with user to determine testing strategy
- **Feedback loop**: Incorporate user testing results into automated test improvements

## Best Practices

### For Main Agent

1. **Never skip backend testing** when backend code changes
2. **Always ask permission** before frontend testing
3. **Read test_result.md** before invoking testing agents
4. **Update test results** after each testing phase
5. **Don't fix issues** already resolved by testing agents

### For Testing Sub-Agents

1. **Update test_result.md** during your run
2. **Provide clear status updates** (working/not working)
3. **Include error details** for failed tests
4. **Suggest specific fixes** for identified issues
5. **Return comprehensive summaries** of testing results

## Error Handling

### When Tests Fail

1. **Analyze test results** carefully
2. **Identify root cause** of failures
3. **Implement targeted fixes** (don't make broad changes)
4. **Re-test after fixes** to confirm resolution
5. **Update test_result.md** with final status

### When Tests Are Blocked

1. **Document blocking issues** in test_result.md
2. **Increment stuck_count** for problematic tasks
3. **Escalate to troubleshoot_agent** if needed
4. **Consider alternative approaches** for stuck tasks

Remember: The goal is thorough, efficient testing that builds confidence in the application while respecting user preferences and time constraints.
